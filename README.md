Medley is a fast and modern web framework for Node.js. It fully supports both `async`/`await` and
callbacks and is compatible with Node 6 or greater. It's design incorporates concepts found in
[Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa),
[hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi), and [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify).
Most importantly, Medley aims to provide an API that is forward-compatible with future versions
that will take full advantage of Node's [`HTTP/2` module](https://nodejs.org/api/http2.html).


## Usage

Install:

```sh
npm install @medley/medley
# or
yarn add @medley/medley
```

Create a web server:

```js
const medley = require('@medley/medley')
const app = medley()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World')
})

app.listen(3000)
```

## Features

+ An API similar to [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
+ Performance on par with [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify)
+ Full support for both `async`/`await` and callbacks
+ Automatic `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, and `405` responses
+ Facilities for safely extending the framework ([extensions](https://github.com/medleyjs/medley/blob/master/docs/Extensions.md))
+ 100% test coverage
+ HTTP/2 support

### Forward-Compatibility with the `http2` Module

HTTP/2 is the future of the web. It is faster than HTTP/1.x and comes with new, speed-boosting
features such as [server push](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/guide-http2-server-push/).
The Node.js `http2` module has a very different API from the `http`/`https` modules, but it also provides a
[compatibility API](https://nodejs.org/api/http2.html#http2_compatibility_api). Medley currently
uses the compatibility API (to support both HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2), but Medley's API is designed such
that when Medley upgrades to the full `http2` API, application code built on Medley should not need
to change. Medley's goal is to insulate application code from this transition (as much as possible)
so that code written now that won't require massive rewrites in the future.
