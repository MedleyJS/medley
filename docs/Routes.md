# Routes
You have two ways to declare a route with Fastify, the shorthand method and the full declaration. Let's start with the second one:
<a name="full-declaration"></a>
### Full declaration
```js
fastify.route(options)
```
* `method`: currently it supports `'DELETE'`, `'GET'`, `'HEAD'`, `'PATCH'`, `'POST'`, `'PUT'` and `'OPTIONS'`. It could also be an array of methods.

* `url`: the path of the url to match this route (alias: `path`).
* `responseSchema`: The schema for a JSON response. See the [`Serialization` documentation](Serialization.md).
* `beforeHandler(request, reply, done)`: a [function](Hooks.md#before-handler) called just before the request handler, useful if you need to perform authentication at route level for example, it could also be and array of functions.
* `handler(request, reply)`: the function that will handle this request.
* `bodyLimit`: prevents the default JSON body parser from parsing request bodies larger than this number of bytes. Must be an integer. You may also set this option globally when first creating the Medley app with `medley(options)`. Defaults to `1048576` (1 MiB).
* `config`: object used to store custom configuration.

  `request` is defined in [Request](Request.md).

  `reply` is defined in [Reply](Reply.md).


Example:

```js
fastify.route({
  method: 'GET',
  url: '/',
  responseSchema: {
    200: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        hello: { type: 'string' }
      }
    }
  },
  handler: function (request, reply) {
    reply.send({ hello: 'world' })
  }
})
```

<a name="shorthand-declaration"></a>
### Shorthand declaration
The above route declaration is more *Hapi*-like, but if you prefer an *Express/Restify* approach, we support it as well:<br>
`fastify.get(path, [options], handler)`<br>
`fastify.head(path, [options], handler)`<br>
`fastify.post(path, [options], handler)`<br>
`fastify.put(path, [options], handler)`<br>
`fastify.delete(path, [options], handler)`<br>
`fastify.options(path, [options], handler)`<br>
`fastify.patch(path, [options], handler)`

Example:

```js
const opts = {
  responseSchema: {
    200: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        hello: { type: 'string' }
      }
    }
  }
}
fastify.get('/', opts, (request, reply) => {
  reply.send({ hello: 'world' })
})
```

`fastify.all(path, [options], handler)` will add the same handler to all the supported methods.

<a name="url-building"></a>
### Url building
Fastify supports both static and dynamic urls.<br>
To register a **parametric** path, use the *colon* before the parameter name. For **wildcard** use the *star*.
*Remember that static routes are always checked before parametric and wildcard.*

```js
// parametric
fastify.get('/example/:userId', (request, reply) => {}))
fastify.get('/example/:userId/:secretToken', (request, reply) => {}))

// wildcard
fastify.get('/example/*', (request, reply) => {}))
```

Regular expression routes are supported as well, but pay attention, RegExp are very expensive in term of performance!
```js
// parametric with regexp
fastify.get('/example/:file(^\\d+).png', (request, reply) => {}))
```

It's possible to define more than one parameter within the same couple of slash ("/"). Such as:
```js
fastify.get('/example/near/:lat-:lng/radius/:r', (request, reply) => {}))
```
*Remember in this case to use the dash ("-") as parameters separator.*

Finally it's possible to have multiple parameters with RegExp.
```js
fastify.get('/example/at/:hour(^\\d{2})h:minute(^\\d{2})m', (request, reply) => {}))
```
In this case as parameter separator it's possible to use whatever character is not matched by the regular expression.

Having a route with multiple parameters may affect negatively the performance, so prefer single parameter approach whenever possible, especially on routes which are on the hot path of your application.

<a name="async-await"></a>
### Async Await
Are you an `async/await` user? We have you covered!
```js
fastify.get('/', options, async function (request, reply) {
  var data = await getData()
  var processed = await processData(data)
  return processed
})
```
As you can see we are not calling `reply.send` to send back the data to the user. You just need to return the body (given that body is not `undefined`) and you are done!
If you need it you can also send back the data to the user with `reply.send`.
```js
fastify.get('/', options, async function (request, reply) {
  var data = await getData()
  var processed = await processData(data)
  reply.send(processed)
})
```

**Warning:** If `return notUndefined` and `reply.send` are used at the same time, the first one that happens takes precedence; the second value will be ignored.

<a name="route-prefixing"></a>
### Route Prefixing
Sometimes you need to maintain two or more different versions of the same api, a classic approach is to prefix all the routes with the api version number, `/v1/user` for example.
Fastify offers you a fast and smart way to create different version of the same api without changing all the route names by hand, *route prefixing*. Let's see how it works:

```js
// server.js
const fastify = require('fastify')()

fastify.register(require('./routes/v1/users'), { prefix: '/v1' })
fastify.register(require('./routes/v2/users'), { prefix: '/v2' })

fastify.listen(3000)
```
```js
// routes/v1/users.js
module.exports = function (fastify, opts, next) {
  fastify.get('/user', handler_v1)
  next()
}
```
```js
// routes/v2/users.js
module.exports = function (fastify, opts, next) {
  fastify.get('/user', handler_v2)
  next()
}
```
Fastify will not complain because you are using the same name for two different routes, because at compilation time it will handle the prefix automatically *(this also means that the performance will not be affected at all!)*.

Now your clients will have access to the following routes:
- `/v1/user`
- `/v2/user`

You can do this as many times as you want, it works also for nested `register` and routes parameter are supported as well.
Be aware that if you use [`fastify-plugin`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-plugin) this option won't work.
